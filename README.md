## Rebuilding the website for the Swedish band **[HAVAMAL](https://havamal-rebuild-test.netlify.app/)**



## The old site I made for Havamal was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Wanting to develop and expand my skills, I rebuilt the site to make it better and faster.


## This website is built using these resources and technologies:

## -GatsbyJS

## -Sanity CMS

## -Cloudinary

## -TailwindCSS

## -Styled Components
